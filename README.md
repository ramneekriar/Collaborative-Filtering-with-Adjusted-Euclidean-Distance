# Collaborative-Filtering-with-Adjusted-Euclidean-Distance

## Overview
This project is part of the **Practical Data Science with Python** course at RMIT University. The assignment focuses on improving the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) based Collaborative Filtering method by implementing a solution that uses Adjusted Euclidean Distance to enhance recommendation accuracy.

## Project Structure
- `Assignment3_framework.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python implementation of the Adjusted Euclidean Distance for kNN-based Collaborative Filtering.
- `Slides.pdf`: Presentation slides explaining the implementation and comparison with standard Collaborative Filtering methods.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Implementation
- **Objective**: Implement the Adjusted Euclidean Distance as described in the provided report to improve the user-user kNN-based Collaborative Filtering method.
- **Steps**:
  - Implemented the Adjusted Euclidean Distance calculation within the provided Python framework.
  - The solution was coded entirely within the designated cell of the `Assignment3_framework.ipynb` file.
  - Detailed comments were added to explain each step of the implementation.

### 2. Presentation
- **Objective**: Present the implementation, explain the concept, and compare the results with the standard kNN-based Collaborative Filtering method.
- **Content**:
  - Explanation of why and how Adjusted Euclidean Distance improves recommendation accuracy.
  - Comparison between the results of the implemented method and the traditional method using Centred Cosine Similarity.
  - Recorded presentation (under 10 minutes) with detailed slides.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have `Anaconda` installed with the necessary packages (`numpy`, etc.).
2. Open `Assignment3_framework.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to execute the implementation and view the results.
4. Review the output, including similarity calculations and recommendation results.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- `numpy` and other relevant libraries as specified in the notebook.
